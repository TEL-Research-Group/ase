Tutorials
=========

This directory contains examples of how to use ASE.

For running the examples install ase.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ase

Some more advanced examples might need additional packages.

We are still porting old tutorials to the current tutorial format.
Many tutorials are available here, but some may not have been ported
yet.  Tutorials still in legacy format can be found under
:ref:`gettingstarted` and :ref:`old_tutorials`.
