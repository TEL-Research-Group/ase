Getting started (legacy format)
===============================


.. note::

   We are porting the ASE tutorials to sphinx-gallery.
   Tutorials in this section will be ported and moved
   to :ref:`tutorials`.

Welcome to the introductory ASE tutorials. This is where to start.

If you are not familiar with Python please read :ref:`pythonintroduction`.

If your ASE scripts make extensive use of matrices you may want to familiarize yourself with :ref:`numpy`.

The
purpose of these tutorials is to teach you the essentials of ASE for
actual production use, and they are regarded as prerequisite for
any of the :ref:`Specialized tutorials <tutorials>`.

Note: Most of this content has been moved to
:ref:`tutorials`.
